                                A leading plastic surgeon’s office near Washington, D.C. helps hundreds of patients a year with injuries to the tendon, ligament of muscle issue that may or may not affect joint function.  Depending on the results of a medical exam, patients may require an x-ray. MRI or sonogram to determine the extent of the damage.  Patients are often the primary source of information on the their injury, responding to traditional pain scales and range of movement estimates.

                                Abantech met with the physicians to demonstrate how they could use an NUI device – in this case a Leap Copter – to capture biometric measurements of a patient’s injuries.  The Leap device, a small, credit card sized NUI, uses cameras and infrared motion sensors to capture movement.  The data is streamed to the device software, which applies a series of complex mathematical algorithms to the captured data.

                                Without Efficio, the device is limited to use in a compatible game.  But now that same functionality is being used to capture motion from a post-operative torn tendon. The Leap Copter captures the range of motion as the patient opens and closes a fist, sending it to a computer where it displays as a 3D model.

                                The doctors can share the model with other consulting physicians and with the patient. No other medical device is needed.  The incremental data capture from the beginning to end of the patient’s treatment provides a comprehensive record of the initial condition and the progress through the healing process.  The data is incorporated into a chart.

                                The outcomes are well received.  Patients can more easily understand their condition because they can see the model. The doctors have a simple diagnostic technology that utilizes innovative methods for patient care.  Plus, the project deliverable serves as new training tool, as well as a vehicle for collaboration with other medical professionals.
